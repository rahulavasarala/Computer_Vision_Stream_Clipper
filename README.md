# Computer_Vision_Stream_Clipper
This is a python gui app that can help people clip their ai computer vision streams, kind of like a game clipping software. You can choose the length of the clip you want, and it clips in real time to mp4 format. 
It uses simple rtsp server to simulate real camera feed, and runs computer vision models on it with intel's dlstreamer docker container. 
This was done with docker and docker compose, gstreamer, dlstreamer, and python tkinter.

Here are some pictures of it in action!
